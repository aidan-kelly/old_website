    <p>Howdy! Today has been spent fiddling around with the html and css of this website. I've been trying to make this place look a little better and I think it is coming along nicely. I also spent some time playing around with the old PC that now run Ubuntu. I managed to download spotify, java, atom and some other software that will make it possible to get my school work done on this new machine. I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge of the command line and learning more about how this operating system works.</p>

    <p>Hello everyone! Today was my first attempt at hosting a website on github. As you can see I got it working. My html and css skills are lacking but imporving daily. If you see anyway I can improve my code let me know! I also managed to change an old PC of mine's operating system over to linux for the first time. I am looking forward to playing around with it in the future. I am still working on learning git and its coming along slowly. I have also started teaching myself about networking. That too is coming along slowly but I am making good progress. I have learned about servers, LAN, MAN and WAN as well as protocols. Thanks for reading!</p>
