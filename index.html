    <h1>Aidan's Daily CPSC Blog</h1>

    <h2>December 9, 2016</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! Today was my first attempt at hosting a website on github. As you can see I got it working. My html and css skills are lacking but imporving daily. If you see anyway I can improve my code let me know! I also managed to change an old PC of mine's operating system over to linux for the first time. I am looking forward to playing around with it in the future. I am still working on learning git and its coming along slowly. I have also started teaching myself about networking. That too is coming along slowly but I am making good progress. I have learned about servers, LAN, MAN and WAN as well as protocols. Thanks for reading!</p>
